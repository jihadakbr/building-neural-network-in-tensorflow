## Objective

In this assignment, we will delve into a powerful deep learning framework that simplifies the process of building neural networks. TensorFlow, along with other popular machine learning frameworks like PaddlePaddle, Torch, Caffe, and Keras, offers a significant acceleration in machine learning development.

Specifically, we will be working with TensorFlow 2.3, which comes with substantial improvements over its predecessor. Throughout this report, we will explore and implement some of these enhancements.

By the conclusion of this assignment, we will have honed the following skills in TensorFlow 2.3: Utilizing tf.Variable to modify the state of a variable, understanding the distinction between a variable and a constant in TensorFlow, and training a Neural Network on a TensorFlow dataset.

The benefits of using programming frameworks like TensorFlow extend beyond simplifying the coding process; they also enable optimizations that enhance the efficiency and speed of the code. Let's dive into the details and uncover the power of TensorFlow 2.3 in boosting our deep learning development capabilities.
